Google App Engine code for the 2012 Roguelike Challenge results page:
http://roguelikechallenge.appspot.com

App code is python, site is javascript.

I can't vouch for all of the links still working, this was LAST YEAR's challenge, but I am putting it up in case someone with more free time than me gets inspired for 2013 and wants to make something much nicer.
